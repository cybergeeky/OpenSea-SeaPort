## Frontend and Backend Development
### If you have questions or need any help, Message me here: [@cyber_lawd](https://t.me/cyber_lawd) 

[OpenSea-Seaport](https://github.com/cyberlawd/OpenSea-SeaPort) is a brand new, open-source, web 3.0 marketplace protocol that enables buying and selling of NFTs safely and efficiently . Launched first on Ethereum, Seaport has helped create a better, more feature-rich experience for our community, while lowering the cost to use web 3.0 marketplaces, like OpenSea. So this is the full implementation of the framework for educational purpose only.

This framework is written using Python [Django](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) as framework. The packages that are being used include [Hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat) (Ethereum dev environment), [Vanilla-extract](https://github.com/seek-oss/vanilla-extract) (styling), [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) (global state management), [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) (database fetching) and [Wagmi](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi) (blockchain fetching). To simplify writable nested serializers package [drf-writable-nested](https://github.com/beda-software/drf-writable-nested) was used also.
